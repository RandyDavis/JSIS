  <!-- WHAT IS A ROUTER 
    Backbone routers are used for routing your applications URL's when using hash tags(#). In the traditional MVC sense they don't necessarily fit the semantics and if you have read "What is a view?" it will elaborate on this point. Though a Backbone "router" is still very useful for any application/feature that needs URL routing/history capabilities.

    Defined routers should always contain at least one route and a function to map the particular route to. In the example below we are going to define a route that is always called.

    Also note that routes interpret anything after "#" tag in the URL. All links in your application should target "#/action" or "#action". (Appending a forward slash after the hashtag looks a bit nicer e.g. http://example.com/#/user/help)


  <script>
    var AppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
      routes: {
        "*actions": "defaultRoute" // matches http://example.com/#anything-here
      }
    });
    // Initiate the router
    var app_router = new AppRouter;

    app_router.on('route:defaultRoute', function(actions) {
      alert(actions);
    })

    // Start Backbone history a necessary step for bookmarkable URL's
    Backbone.history.start();
  </script>
  
  --> <!-- End What is a Router -->




  <!-- DYNAMIC ROUTING 
    Most conventional frameworks allow you to define routes that contain a mix of static and dynamic route parameters. For example you might want to retrieve a post with a variable id with a friendly URL string. Such that your URL would look like "http://example.com/#/posts/12". Once this route was activated you would want to access the id given in the URL string. This example is implemented below.

  <script>
    var AppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
      routes: {
        "posts/:id": "getPost",
        "*actions": "defaultRoute"  // Backbone will try to match the route above first
      }
    });
    // Instantiate the router
    var app_router = new AppRouter;
    app_router.on('route:getPost', function(id) {
      // Note the variable in the route definition being passed in here
      alert("Get post number " + id );
    });
    app_router.on('router:defaultRoute', function(actions) {
      alert(actions);
    });
    // Start Backbone history
    Backbone.history.start();
  </script>

  <!-- DYNAMIC ROUTING CONT. ":params" and "*splats" 
    Backbone uses two styles of variables when implementing routes. First there are ":params" which match any URL components between slashes. Then there are "*splats" which match any number of URL components. Note that due to the nature of a "*splat" it will always be the last variable in your URL as it will match any and all components.

    Any "*splats" or ":params" in route definitions are passed as arguments (in respective order) to the associated function. A route defined as "/:route/:action" will pass 2 variables (“route” and “action”) to the callback function. (If this is confusing please post a comment and I will try articulate it better)

    Here are some examples of using ":params" and "*splats"

  -->

  <script>
    var AppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
      routes: {
        "posts/:id": "getPost",
        // <a href="http://example.com/#/posts/121">Example</a>
        "download*path": "downloadFile"  ,
        // <a href="http://example.com/#/download/user/images/hey.gif">Download</a>
        ":route/:action": "loadView",
        // <a href="http://example/com/#/dashboard/graph">Load Route/Action View</a>
      },
      app_router.on('route:getPost', function(id) {
        alert(id); // 121
      });
      app_router.on('router:downloadFile', function(path) {
        alert(path);  // user/images/hey.gif
      });
      app_router.on('route:loadView', function(route, action) {
        alert(route + "_" + action); // dashboard_graph
      })
    });
    // Instantiate the router
    var app_router = new AppRouter;
    app_router.on('route:getPost', function(id) {
      // Note the variable in the route definition being passed in here
      alert("Get post number " + id );
    });
    app_router.on('router:defaultRoute', function(actions) {
      alert(actions);
    });
    // Start Backbone history
    Backbone.history.start();
  </script>
